## Overview
The objective of this repo is to provide some reference applications where partner can add its sensor modules to the current QC Studio enviroment.

## Tools
To use this repo users must have:

Hardware
* EK-RA6M4
* US082-INTERPEVZ
* US159-DA14531EVZ
* US159-DA16200MEVZ

Software
* FSP 5.3.0 platform installer bundle (e2_studio + FSP)

### Instructions For contribuiting
1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/new_module`)
3. Import the reference projects (sensordummy) on your e2studio using the `Rename and import Exisiting C/C++ Project into Workspace`.
[Changing an e² studio project name](https://en-support.renesas.com/knowledgeBase/21225277#:~:text=On%20the%20project%20import%20wizard,name%20in%20the%20current%20workspace.)
    * module name: sensor1
        * ek_ra6m4_sensor1_da14531_baremetal_custom_profile
        * ek_ra6m4_sensor1_da16200_freertos_adafruit_cloud
4. Each project will guide you about which portion should be adapted to the new sensor

5. Create a new application folder with your company and sensor name.
6. After testing them, add the two projects with your modifications to this folder
7. Create a new folder on images with your company and sensor name, then add the 3D rendered module image.
8. Create a new folder on docs with your company and sensor name, then add the module documentation.
9. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add a new_module'`)
10. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/new_module`)
11. Create a pull request to the QCS_Silicon Partner repository
